List::Regexp module
===================

The module provides a function that builds a regular expression that will
match any string from the input list of strings.  The generated expression
is much more efficient than the equivalent regexp obtained by mere
concatenation of all strings from the list with a '|' as separator.

Three kinds of regular expressions can be generated: Perl regexps (the
default), POSIX extended, and Emacs-style.

Additionally, the generated regexp can be restricted to match whole words
only, or words appearing on a line alone.

The module is inspired by the GNU Emacs regexp-opt function.

Example of its usage:

  use List::Regexp;
  my $rx = regexp_opt(@strings);
  .
  .
  .
  if ($input =~ qr/$rx/) {
    .
    .
    .
  }

regexp-opt utility
==================

This utilitiy offers a command line interface to the module.  It collects
its arguments and prints out a regular expression that will match any of
them.  E.g.:

  $ regexp-opt --word string test stringent 
  \<(string(ent)?|test)\>
